# Canvas Transitions
A collection of Canvas animations to transition between, well, anything!

## The plan
- Make a JS command that adds a canvas element that's auto injected on doc ready
- user's specify in params transition type, length and a callback function(?)
- transitions will range from simple "Screen Wipes" to nostalgic GBA era inspired ones.

# Run it locally
- clone repo
- cd into
- npm i
- npm run dev
- it's now running on localhost, click the buttons to fire animations
  

# This is a hobby repo
This is a silly hobby repo, it will take a while to get anything of substance here!
